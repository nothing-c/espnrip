Oneliner ver:

espn rss feed
- nabber (perl) to create ticker
  - https://www.espn.com/espn/news/story?page=rssinfo
  - split on >< (odds of that being in the actual title are miniscule) and grep for title

- llm summarizer (quick and simple, just dump the article in) [need to work out the prompt I want to use, but otherwise good]
  - could use claude https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits (decent free tier)
- I could also run a quick server to dump the links into a page, drudge-esque (cgi addition when I get that rolling, perhaps), or not do a server and just autogen the page
